## Chambers (2015) Scales

### 8-item system-justification scale
Kay, A. C., and Jost, J. T. (2003). Complementary justice: Effects of "poor but happy" and "poor but honest" stereotype exemplars on system justification and implicit activation of the justice motive. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85, 823 - 837.
doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.823

From page 828:

> In the "second study," participants were asked to complete an eight-item questionnaire measuring perceptions of the fairness, legitimacy, and justifiability of the prevailing social system. The scale was constructed for this research program in order to measure situational (rather than dispositional, as in BJW or PWE scales) effects on system justification (see also Jost & Kay, 2003).

Items were as follows:

- "In general, you find society to be fair"
- "In general, the American political system operates as it should"
- "American society needs to be radically restructured" (reverse-scored)
- "The United States is the best country in the world to live in"
- "Most policies serve the greater good"
- "Everyone has a fair shot at wealth and happiness"
- "Our society is getting worse every year" (reverse-scored)
- "Society is set up so that people usually get what they deserve"

Participants initially indicated their degree of agreement or disagreement with each item on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 9 (strongly disagree), but the scores were recoded prior to analyses so that higher scores would indicate increased levels of system justification. A mean system justification score was calculated for each participant by collapsing across the eight items, which formed a reliable scale (alpha = .87).

### 14-item social-dominance-orientation scale
Pratto, F., Sidanius, J., Stallworth, L. M., & Malle, B. F. (1994).Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, 741 - 763.

From Appendix A (page 760)

"Which of the following objects or statements do you have a positive or negative feeling towards? Beside each object or statement, place a number from 1 to 7 which represents the degree of your positive or negative feeling. The scale was labeled very positive (7), positive (6), slightly positive (5), neither positive nor negative (4), slightly negative (3), negative (2), and very negative (1).

- Some groups of people are simply not the equals of others
- Some people are just more worthy than others
- This country would be better off if we care less about how equal all people were
- Some people are just more deserving than others
- It is not a problem if some people have more of a chance in life than others
- Some people are just inferior to others
- To get ahead in life, it is sometimes necessary to step on others
- Increased economic equality
- Increased social equality
- Equality
- If people were treated more equally we would have fewer problems in this country
- In an ideal work, all nations would be equal
- We should try to treat one another as equals as much as possible. (All humans should be treated equally.)
- It is important that we treat other countries as equals.

"All items were measured on a very negative (1) to very positive (7) scales. Items 8-14 were reverse-coded. The version of Item 13 in parentheses was used in Samples 5-12. The order of items differed from above and across samples."

## Cruces Questions

- "Do you think that the government should help poor people by giving them money? (1) Yes; (0) No."
- "Do you think that the government should help poor people by giving them food? (1) Yes; (0) No."
- "Do you think that the government should help poor people by helping them to find a good job? (1) Yes; (0) No"

(Variable representing the mean of the response to the three previous questions. Aggregate variable based on the help with money, help with food and help find jobs questions. The process consists of demeaning each variable, converting each to effect sizes by dividing the result by the control group's standard deviation, and taking the average of the effect sizes (Kling et al., 2007))


## McCall Questions

### Chapter 3: Income Inequality
- Differences in income in America are too large (INCGAP)
- Inequality continues to exist because it benefits the rich and powerful (INEQUAL5)
- Large differences in income are necessary for America's prosperity (INEQUAL3)
- Subquestion: The way things are in America, people like me and my family have a good chance of improving our standard of living.

### Chapter 4: Opportunity
- A forced-choice question asking whether the 'most important' reason that 'people get ahead' is 'their own hard work,' 'lucky breaks or help from other people,' or both equally.
- Importance of various factors in getting ahead in life: hard work, having a good education yourself, ambition, natural ability, knowing the right people, having well-educated parents, coming from a wealthy family, a person's race
- Perceived pay for chairman of a large national corporation, unskilled worker in a factory, doctor in a general practice: "We would like to know what you think people in these jobs actually earn. Please write in how much you think they usually earn, each year, before taxes."
- Desired pay for chairman of a large national corporation, unskilled worker in a factory, doctor in a general practice: "Next, what do you think people in those jobs ought to be paid - how much do you think they should earn each year before taxes, regardless of what they actually get?"

- ***From American National Election Study:***
	- Our society should do whatever is necessary to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.
	- If people were treated more equally in this country we would have many fewer problems.
	- One of the big problems in this country is that we don't give everyone an equal chance.
	- It is not really that big a problem if some people have more of a chance in life than others.
	- We have gone too far in pushing equal rights in this country.
	- This country would be better off if we worried less about how equal people are.

### Chapter 5: Social Policy Preferences
- We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. Are we spending too much money, too little money, or about the right amount on:
	- assistance to the poor
	- welfare
	- improving the nation's education
	- education
	- health
	- improving and protecting the nation's health
	- social security
- Should the government do everything possible to improve the standard of living of all poor Americans, or should each person take care of himself?
- Should the government reduce income differences between rich and poor, perhaps by raising taxes of wealthy families or by giving income assistance to the poor, or should the government not concern itself with reducing differences?
- Generally, how would you describe taxes in America today, meaning all taxes together, including social security, income tax, sales tax, and all the rest: First for those with high incomes?
- Do you think that people with high incomes should pay a larger share of their income in taxes than those with low incomes, the same share, or a smaller share?
- Do you agree or disagree that it is the responsibility of the government to reduce differences in income between people with high incomes and those with low incomes?
