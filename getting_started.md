## Getting Started With “Perceiving Inequality” Project

### Motivations
- Research suggests perceptions of inequality are not very accurate. Research also suggests college graduates’ perceptions of economic fairness develop through campus socialization, campus norms about financial gain, beliefs about merit, etc. How do these higher education processes relate to college students’ perceptions of inequality?
- Specifically, how accurate are elite college students’ perceptions of how much income inequality there is? And how accurate are their understandings of where they will fall in the income distribution after graduating?
- Does knowledge of the income distribution (and one’s perceived place in it) shape college students’ preferences for particular jobs or incomes? Is placement in the income distribution a reason why students are more or less interested in a particular job?

### To Dos
- Literature review using readings in Zotero
	- Start with “background experiments” folder.
		- For substantive issues: What are the outcomes related to political and social preferences? What are the key findings? What experimental conditions are associated with changes in perceptions?
		- For methodological issues: Note specific surveys, question wording, sampling strategies, and experimental conditions (are there treatment and control groups, etc.). Are they talking about income or wealth, for example? Do the experiments use real or fictional examples? Are questions about point in time estimates or trends? Is education level a  predictor of anything? Which experiments are about individual perceptions (where I think I am or want to be in the distribution) and which are about macro perceptions (what the overall distribution in this country is)?
	- Second group is the “bridge readings” folder.
		- What are Mijs’ examples from higher education?
		- Is “merit” Mijs’ only focus or does he get into any of the socialization issues Mendelberg and Binder discuss?
	- Final group is the “education readings” folder.
		- Any overlaps in Mendelberg et al’s survey questions and the questions in the background experiments?
		- Any overlaps in campus characteristics and predictors of perceptions in background experiments (like campus socioeconomic diversity and Cruces’ claims about friend group heterogeneity)?
		- Much of the answer to the “why does it matter?” question for this project comes from Mendelberg’s discussion of college students’ policy preferences becoming the policy preferences of people who will have power in the future. What other references are there to pull for that issue.
		- How do perceptions of future *income* show up in these readings (rather than perceptions of prestige or success, etc.)?
- Data Assembly
	- What is available on Handshake? Any salary data? Don’t contact CCI…just see what is easily accessible.
	- Information about national income distributions comes from CPS and IPUMS. Can be “grouped by” age, race, education level, location.
	- What are Qualtrics’ experimental limits?
     - Is there existing survey data to use for this project rather than experimental data? Does the Mendelberg et al HERI data set have anything useful?
